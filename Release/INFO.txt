What to do if:
	I enter the menu item number, but nothing changes:
		Perhaps bring the number not corresponding to the number
		from the menu. Try again.
	The program writes that the file does not exist or it is empty:
		Do not worry. You can continue work. You can add new
		elements in your list. After work, your new list will

	I saw "Fatal error, Can't work" on my screen
		As written, this error is fatal. The program will not
		work. Try restarting the program.
